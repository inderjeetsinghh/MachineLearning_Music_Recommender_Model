# Machine Learning Setup and Workflow

## 🚀 Setting Up the Environment

### **1. Install Anaconda**

Anaconda is recommended for Machine Learning projects as it includes all major AI libraries in one place.

- Download Anaconda: [Anaconda Official Site](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- Comes with built-in Jupyter Notebook (Best for ML & Data Science)

---

## 📊 Dataset Selection

You can use **Kaggle** ([Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)) for acquiring high-quality datasets.
but in this example I used own create csv file to sample testing, it all depends on you how much data you want to train

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

### **1. Pandas** 📊 (Data Analysis)

- Provides DataFrames (2D data structures like rows & columns)
- Used for cleaning, processing, and analyzing datasets

### **2. Scikit-Learn** 🤖 (Machine Learning)

- Provides ML algorithms like **Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.**

### **3. Joblib** (Model Persistence)

- Used to save and load trained models

---

## 📌 Notes

- Always use Jupyter Notebook for ML projects due to frequent data inspection.
- Use **joblib** for saving models to avoid retraining.
- Use **Kaggle** for high-quality datasets.

### 🏆 **Happy Machine Learning! 🚀**
